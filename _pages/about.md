<h2 style="margin: 30px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>
I am now a master's student in the <a href='http://english.geo.bnu.edu.cn/'>Faculty of Geographical Sciences, Beijing Normal University</a> (top 3 subject ranking in China). Under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nN9n9u8AAAAJ'>Prof. Jin Chen</a>, my previous research mainly focused on **agricultural remote sensing**, including data quality improvement for agricultural regions and crop mapping. I aim to integrate multi-source remote sensing data, to study the interactions between agriculture and food security, water conflicts, and global climate.

<h2 style="margin: 30px 0px 10px;">Prospective PhD Student</h2>
**I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position starting in 2024 Fall**, related to remote sensing, agriculture, food security, global climate, ecosystems, earth systems, plants, and forests.

<h2 style="margin: 30px 0px 10px;">My Strengths</h2>
- üõ∞Ô∏è**Rich experience in remote sensing**: Proficient in satellite data processing & analysis through programming and professional software.
- üìë**Scientific research training**: Completed one first-author paper, accepted by *Remote Sensing of Environment* (SCI, IF=13.5).
- üåè**Solid Geography background**: Explored various branches of geography with high GPAs, including physical geography (e.g., ecology, climatology) and human geography (e.g., economic geography, urban geography).
- üöÄ**Active and fast learner**: Constantly stepping out of my comfort zone with broad experience in phenology, deep learning, etc.

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1"> 
  - **Background**: Previous data fusion methods that synthesize high-quality remote sensing data fail to reconstruct high-spatial-resolution images of key phenological periods in agricultural scenarios.
  - **Methodology**: An innovative algorithm, Agri-Fuse, was developed to highlight phenological change information for the first time.
  - **Results**: Outperformed three benchmarks and one state-of-the-art algorithm, and improved the overall accuracy of crop classification from 88% to 92%.
